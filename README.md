# DiscordBot
Very basic Discord bot made for my server with functions such as interacting with messages, retrieving user data, welcoming new users, etc.

Tried to implement a function to count total messages sent by user, however the only current possible way for this is to have to bot
search through every singl message sent in the server, check who each message was sent by, and add them up. This unfortunately would 
take way too long to be used as a reliable feature, so I commented my attempt at it out.
